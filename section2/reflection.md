## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

In regards to asking questions, I feel I'm right in the middle. I mostly appreciated the last article "Your Questions are Ridiculous; Ask Them Anyway". The hardest part about Googling is that it doesn't understand where I am in my learning journey, what context I have, and what scope I'm looking for. I struggle with finding the "right" words to use for Googling, because I feel like by nature of still being in Mod 0, we only have a tiny amount of technical language to search with. On the flip side, I know that I've challenged myself and committed that I will continue to hone my Googling skills, and keep myself honest to my time and reach out when I need help. If I can describe what I have done to figure out the question, I haven't done enough research on my own.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I was comfortable with running node to run my files, but at first I was frustrated by the amount of learning I had to do on my own, I always prefer a classroom setting, hence why I joined a bootcamp. But after getting through the comparisons section, wow that took a lot of extra googling, I'm honestly thankful for being pushed out of my comfort zone. One of my big goals to accomplish was to gain more confidence in my googling ability, and the push on independent learning in this section really strengthen my muscle. I think one of the biggest misses tradition education has is the lack of providing real world experience during the 4 year degree process. Teaching us how to teach ourselves (in a guided way by pointing us in the right direction in some areas) has really helped to build my confidence. Maybe I CAN do this!

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement provides code path options given certain conditions. An example of this in daily life is, if there are eggs in the refrigerator, make eggs for breakfast, if there are no eggs, eat nothing. An example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application is if there is an unread email in your inbox, put an alert of how many unread messages are next to the inbox title, if there are no unread messages, do nothing.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

Multiple conditions are added to a `if` statement by using `if/else` statements. Programs read if and if/else statements as having a series of options given different conditions. If the condition meets expectations of the if statement, meaning the if condition is true, it proceeds in that path. If the `if` condition is not true, meaning false, and an `if/else` condition has been set, the program will move to see if it can meet the `if/else` condition. If the `if/else` is true, the program will continue using the `if/else` condition path. The program will continuously check for a true condition until it arrives at the end of the code block.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

The tools available to a developer to check that TWO conditions are met would be to use the AND logical operator `&&` in the condition, to check if 1 of 2 conditions are met, the `||` OR logical operator would be used. Run the conditions through terminal using the node command to test if the conditions returned as expected.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I need to do more practice to see how `if` statement returns are manipulated by logical operators.
