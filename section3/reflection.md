## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- What resonated with me the most from the article was the concpet of taking time to reflect on the process. It's funny because in the arrays exercise, we were asked to recall and use skills from section 2, and it felt like almost a call out to say "Hey! This process is more than getting it done and checking the box!" It felt like a call out to say, are you retaining and growing your mind to remember all that you've learned? I appreciated the call out to reflecting on the process.

- The other concept that resonated with me was the concept of seeking out challenges. As so many people say, as we get older we're subconsciously making decisions to eliminate risk in life, and it translates to all aspects of how we live, including work. Coming to Turing and learning and doing something complete new is a challenge, and it has been a wake up call of putting myself outside of my comfort zone so I can in return grow.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

*Do*
- I feel some what confident to say that I understand mistakes are essential to learning and I'm definitely not afraid to seek help.

*Do Not*
- As I said in my previous answer, I'm definitely averse to taking on challenges. I'd like to think with the decision to take on software development, maybe that is changing? But at the very least I am reminded of how and why it is important.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

- Developers may use arrays on a site like Pinterest. Each image or pin on Pinterest has a series of tags (data points) associated with the image. For example a picture of a kitchen may have the tags lighting, cabinets, home, remodel, interior design. Each of those tags (data points) would be held in an array for that specific picture of the kitchen (the variable). When the user searches for the word lighting, that data point in the array for the kitchen picture will be called, and the user can view that image.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

- An array is used to add or remove values from an Array.  

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When would we use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- A loop allows a program to perform an action a given number of times without having to write new code each time.
- A loop should be ran with an array when an action needs to be performed on each data point.
- A loop would be used without an array when using a loop for a counter, or when the same action doesn't need to be performed on each item in an array.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- A loop tells the computer when to start reading and stop reading code.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I question if I understand why a loop would be used without an array :) I think I have it right, but I'll probably need to ask someone since Google wasn't helping.
