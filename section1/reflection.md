#Section 1 Reflections

##How did SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or more of? Is there anything not on this list that you would add?
-What do I do already? Already, I know to take care of my brain and take breaks. In the past year I've realized the importance of resting my brain. Actively noticing if I'm resting my body but still thinking about work, or numbing my brain without giving it any rest. Working on taking breaks that pull my mind away from the previous task at hand, and into something enjoyable has helped me become a better student already!

-What do I want to do more of or start doing? I want to be better at viewing learning as a process instead of a destination. I struggle with perfectionism and wanting to get the task completed with a 100%, even though if I was only able to score well on the test or assignment, but don't fully grasp the real world application it's not 100%. Similarly, I understand languages are updating all the time, so I have to become comfortable with always having something to learn and a grow with. A lot of what goes into being a Super Learning is strong self care, you have to be kind to yourself to strive for a growth mindset, to give yourself breaks, and give yourself time to read.

Recently I've been enjoying self affirmation. To talk to yourself in the affirmative is so fulfilling. I think it's too common to hear phrases like "you can do it!", but when reading that statement even just in your head it's not self talk. The importance of shifting to "I can do it!" has been SO impactful for me, and I think that's a skill all Super Learners should acquire. Positive self talk is a gam changer.

##What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
The data types we learned in this section and their definitions are:

-Number: the number data type is information of a whole number (long or short, positive or negative) and floating point numbers (decimals).

-String: A string is a series of characters; letters, numbers or special characters, surrounded by either single or double quotes, the surrounding quotes need to be the same type.

-Boolean: A boolean is true or false statement for the computer to interpret based on an event or equation provided.

##How would you log the string "Hello World" to the console?
console.log(Hello World!)

##What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
The character or characters used to indicate comments in a JavaScript file are // for a single line and /* comments in between */ for multiple lines of comments. The purpose of code comments is to notate what the purpose of the code is, or to explain the update made to the code.

##In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a command to the computer to store data. The way I would describe a variable to a 5 year old would be a variable tells the computer hey! Remember this piece of information.

##In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is a way to combine different pieces of data points into  a series or phrase.

##Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think developers use concatenation?
On Netflix, when you log in there are a series of TV Shows that are recommended under the category of 'Popular on Netflix'. I believe concatenation would be used to create the list of options under that category.

##What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far?
Honestly my biggest question is how much more should I be doing
