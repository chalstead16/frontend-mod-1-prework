## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

- The workflow with Pomodoro was AMAZING! I loved learning this technique! I found time estimating was easier because the section had an overall estimate. Using that I was able to estimate how long each part would take by previewing how much content was in each part. I really liked having the ticking of the timer as a reminder to stay focused on the task at hand.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

- My first goal was to complete Part B in 3 hours, I completed it in an hour and 35 minutes. It was much easier to focus when I had mini-breaks. I ended up setting my measurement to 30 minute increments with 5 minute breaks.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

- An `Object` is similar to an `Array` in that they both hold a list of complex data, the biggest difference is the `Object` can use Strings and Index positions for accessing data. Object do not have an order, unlike Arrays. Lastly, Objects can store multiple data points in their key value pairings.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array because the names are only a single data point.
  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object because there are multiple data points, the state name and a key for the capital name.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Array because each item to pack is a single data point.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Array because each account name a single data point.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Object because there are multiple data points, the student name would be a key and the cohort would be a key.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object because there are multiple data points, the ingredient name would be a key and the amount would be a key.
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - Array because each restaurant is a single data point.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

- Web App: Book of the Month, monthly subscription to select a book to order for the month.
- Object: Each book could be an object
- Keys: Image of the book cover, genre, description, title
- Values: Image of book cover, "Historical Fiction", "The Family"

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

- I need to do more practice and research to understand the relationship between function and method.
